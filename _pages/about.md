Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Postdoctoral Scholar** at the [Natural Language Processing Group][UCSB], [University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)][UCSBSchool]. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [William Yang Wang][William]. I completed my PhD from [National University of Singapore][NUS] in 2022, where I was advised by Prof. [Min-Yen Kan][Min] and Prof. [Tat-Seng Chua][Chua] and worked on complex question answering and generation. Previously, I received my Master's degree from [Tsinghua University][Tsinghua] (2014 - 2017, advised by Prof. [Juanzi Li][juanzili] and Prof. [Jie Tang][jietang]) and my Bachelor's degree from [Beihang University][BUAA] (2010 - 2014). 

My primary research lies in the area of **natural language processing and machine learning**. The overarching goal of my research is: *how to build trustworthy large language models that are logical, truthful, and safe.* Specifically: 
- <i class="fa-solid fa-flask"></i> **Reasoning**: How/why can LLMs consistently perform logical and faithful reasoning?
- <i class="fas fa-search"></i> **Truthfulness**: How can LLMs produce accurate, un-biased, and up-to-date information?
- <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> **Safety**: How can we discover and mitigate the potential harm caused by LLMs?
